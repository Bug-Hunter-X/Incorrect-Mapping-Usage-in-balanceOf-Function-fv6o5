# Incorrect Mapping Usage in balanceOf Function
This Solidity code demonstrates a common error in accessing mappings: Incorrectly referencing the mapping itself instead of the mapping's values. 
The `balanceOf` function attempts to return the entire mapping instead of the balance for a specific address.  This will result in incorrect balance values and likely revert the transaction.
The solution shows the proper way to access mapping values using the correct syntax.
